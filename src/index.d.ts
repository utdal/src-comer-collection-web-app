// This is not a TypeScript project (at least not yet).
// I am defining types here only to add them to JSDocs
// throughout the project, and also to help with autocomplete
// in Visual Studio Code.  While editing the project in VS Code,
// this file should be kept open in the background to allow the 
// editor to resolve the types.
